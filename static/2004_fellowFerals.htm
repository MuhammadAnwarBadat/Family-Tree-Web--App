Saturday afternoon, Olivier comes over for a play date with Max.<br>
After a couple of hours of shouting, arguing, wrestling, throwing, <br>
food messes, squalling guitars and other testosterone <br>
I say let's get outta here, plz?<br>
Max takes his little training wheel bike and rides round the block. <br> 
Olivier and I walk/run along side him scraping, laughing.<br>
We park the bike around the corner by a building with a wizened strip of grass <br>
the boys love to play on. <br>
The building doorman tries to chase them off like feral dogs <br>
while I coax them to stay and play, a feral dog spawning dogs.<br>
I guess the Man dozes this Saturday because they play unfettered for awhile.<br>
Then they kneel down by a wire fence near an alley <br>
scraping runes in the dirt<br>
talking quietly with the intimacy of little boys.<br>
<br>
It turns cold by late afternoon --<br>
the boys, ungloved, jackets open, glow red hope<br>
but for me, it seeps to my bones -<br>
standing still on the sidwalk<br>
listening little to the little boys whisper<br>
and watching <br>
the wind dance with the maple trees<br>
and the dusk gather over 110th.<br>
